# Cyber_security NMAP
Nmap, also known as network map, is potentially used for scanning open ports. By scanning open ports we can potentially identify vulnerabilities of any platforms not urls. It can use -Ss Syn Scan and -sV for finding the version. The devices connected to the same network of the local host are checked for finding open ports. TCP transmission Control Protocol is used for reliable communication over a network. The open ports found are upnp- Universal plug and play that's usually used for automatic device discovery and communication. Such a port is not very reliable due to automatic ports opening and weak authentication. The other port found is afs3-fileserver which is used for legacy file sharing where it can become a vulnerability if not secured properly (files can leak sensitive information)
