Objective: Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to
understand network exposure.

Step1:
 this is used for getting local ip addresses
for a network map to function properly we have to use syn Scan 

ipconfig getifaddr en0

Step2:
sudo nmap -sS IPaddress/24    ####sudo to change to super user for priviledges

output:
Host is up (0.0086s latency).     ####LAN
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)  ####one port open
PORT   STATE SERVICE
53/tcp open  domain    ####domain name system
MAC Address: macAddress (Unknown)

Host is up (0.000028s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
5000/tcp open  upnp    #####Universal Plug and Play â€“ used by smart devices, routers, or media servers.
7000/tcp open  afs3-fileserver    ####legacy file sharing


Step3:
for html file conversion:

sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 -oX scan_result.xml
xsltproc scan_result.xml -o scan_result.html  

Step4:
Reading the file:
cat scan_result.txt

# Nmap 7.95 scan initiated Mon May 26 18:25:20 2025 as: nmap -sS -oN scan_result.txt 192.168.1.0/24
# Nmap done at Mon May 26 18:28:46 2025 -- 256 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 206.98 seconds
